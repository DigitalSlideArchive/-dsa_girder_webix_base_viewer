Digital Slide Archive
=============================

This version of the Digital Slide Archive (DSA) uses Girder for the backend and Webix UI for the frontend. 
It also provides two types of UIs that you can set in the app/config.js file. Those UIs are the TCGA UI and the standard
UI, which I will discuss in more details below. The repo provides the base version for this DSA, but you can also create plugins and widgets
to add mroe functionalities, which you will find examples of in app/plugins. This keeps the DSA components independent and the code cleaner.

Dependencies:
-----------------------------
Before installing the DSA make sure you install the following:
