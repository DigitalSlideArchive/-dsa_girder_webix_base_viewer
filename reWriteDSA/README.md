## This is the main viewer repository for the DSA web client

We support plugins, and I am using Webix as the main UI component, as well as openseadragon for most of the viewer code.


## Getting started

We are using npm as the basic package manager

    npm install


## Starting a basic server

	For now, I am using a python server, may debate switching to a nodejs version at some point.  To start the server just type:

	python simpleTestServer.py




### NPM Reminders

    npm install <package> --save  

This will add it as a required package

    npm install <package> --save-dev

This adds it as a non-required package, but useful for development
